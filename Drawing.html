        I Developed An Intrest In Drawing When I Was Arounf 6 Years Old. 
        I Was Exceptionally Good At It And Enjoyed Drawing Mostly Cartoons , During 4th Grade I Had A Bunch Of Freinds And At That Time Pokemon Was Everyones Favourite. So One Of My Freind Came Up With The Idea To Draw Pokemon And That Led Everyone To Start DRawing Pokemons And Even I Started Drawing Pokemons .  And This Indulged Me In Drawing Even More.
        We Drew Pokemon Day And Night During The lunch Break And Times When We Were Free. Now Me Being Good At Drawing I drew Around 400 Pokemon In Total At The End Of 4th Grade I Still Sometimes Draw Pokemon But Not As Often As I Used To Do Before The Total Count Is 436 As Of Now .( I Wished To Reach 1000 But There Are Only  898 Pokemons , Lol)

    Apart From Pokemon I Draw Graffiti And Doodle Art And Some Other Types As well
    Here Are Some Of My  Drawings (I Wish I Could Show Each One Of My Drawing But I Cant Because I Have Over A 1000 and i dont think you would see a 1000 drawings)
